# Miguel Rojas Saavedra

This personal ePortfolio was created for my CS‑499 Capstone Project at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). It showcases my academic growth, technical skills, and professional development throughout the Computer Science program.

## CS499 | ePortfolio

### Introduction & Professional Self Assessment

My name is Miguel and I started pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering in August 2024, effectively completing the career I started back in my home country, Venezuela.  :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

As I’ve progressed through the program, the most important skills I have learned so far have been coding in different languages, being able to program mobile apps, develop websites, apply databases knowledge, and learn more about algorithms and its applications in software efficiency. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

I just graduated as a software developer, and a database administrator. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

Outside of the artifacts contained in this course, I’ve worked with vectors and arrays, linked lists, and hashmaps, as well as secure CRUD operations with MongoDB and SQL. I have also worked with SQLite for a project that I needed to develop an android application for. I have developed weebsites using Angular, Figma, and worked with HTML. These experiences, paired with other assignments that have emphasized secure coding practices, have helped solidify my ability to write clean, efficient, and secure code. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

## Portfolio Summary

The artifacts and enhancements exhibited in this course were selected to demonstrate a range of technical and professional skills that align with the five course outcomes across three categories:

- **Software Design & Engineering**
- **Algorithms & Data Structures**
- **Databases** :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

1. **Enhanced Modular Calculator Software Project**  
   I will demonstrate that this software can be ported into another language (Python) without losing its functionality, and I will implement enhancements that will make it a more complete and useful calculator, with a structure that will open a door for future enhancements and reusable code. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

2. **Enhanced Binary Search Tree Project**  
   For enhancements, I have thought of developing and implementing a self-balancing binary search tree, which would help its performance; and to add a destructor for memory management because this project could have memory leaks due to the lack of one.  :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

3. **Enhanced Clock Software with a Database Implementation**  
   I will develop a manual clock that will give the hour in a 12 hour format and 24 hour format. This was developed in CS 210 for Module 3. I have some ideas about adding quality of life enhancements like automatic time progression and time zones support. It will have a database included in it that will use SQLite with information like time zones.  :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

## Course Outcomes

1. Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.
2. Design and deliver professional‑quality oral, written, and visual communications.  
3. Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.   
4. Demonstrate innovative techniques and tools in computing to deliver value.  
5. My enhancements will align with designing and delivering computing solutions in this app that will increase its value because the clock will have new features compared to the original project and that it will get a database implemented, proving that this project can be effectively done with a high quality purpose, and open to be expandable in the future.  :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

## Code Review Video

My code review discusses existing functionality, code analysis, and planned enhancements, using a checklist to identify areas for improvement (e.g., logic, security, documentation).
